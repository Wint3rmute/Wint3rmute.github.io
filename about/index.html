In my high-school years, after getting a grip on the basics of programming, I’ve turned to WebDev, which has been my passion for the last years of high school and first years of uni.\nI’ve been field tested during Nokia Innovative Projects, scoring a second place with a project of a global, team-based RTS game - Consquare (kind of like Pokemon Go, except you actually get to affect the world around you, not just change the color of some statically placed structures on the map). We wrote game in Unity and the server software in Django.\nThe future? I’ve started programming with C/C++, then switched to high-level languages and technologies. My plan is to go full circle and return to low-level - probably with Rust. I’ll try to combine my Linux knowledge and low-level programming (backed by high-level prototyping and testing), to develop on embedded devices or to build high-performance server/desktop apps.\n Here’s some non-programming stuff about me, if you’re still interested\n","wordCount":"494","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://wint3rmute.github.io/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":" "},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wint3rmute.github.io/about/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Mateusz Bączek","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wint3rmute.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wint3rmute.github.io accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://github.com/wint3rmute.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a>
